# Telco-Churn-Prediction
Telecom churn data includes information about a fictional telecom company that provided home phone and internet service to 7,043 customers in California in the third quarter. It shows which customers left, stayed, or signed up for their service. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict which customers will leave the company.
